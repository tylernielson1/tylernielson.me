                <p>
					I was born In Logan, Utah, while my dad was attending Utah Sate University. I decided to make my appearance into this world the day before finals week started. We moved to Laramie, Wyoming a week after my first birthday, where my dad continued his education at University of Wyoming and began his career in the cement industry as an Environmental Engineer.
					When I was 5, we moved to Bettendorf, Iowa, where we lived until I was almost 12. During that time I lost my only child status and was joined by one brother and a sister. My mom remembers my kindergarten teacher telling her I was destined to be an engineer. It was also about the time I started to love anything computer and video game related.
				</p>
				<p>
					Moving to Shawnee, Kansas, just as I was starting 7th grade, was one of the worst times of my childhood. I didn't think I'd ever forgive my parents, but it ended up being a good thing for me, living in a neighborhood where lots of kids lived and strong friendships were formed. The highlight being my youngest brother joining our family. As I was 13 at the time, I gladly took the role of protector and babysitter and I'm still one of his favorite people.
				</p>
				<p>
					I attended Mill Valley High School, where I was involved in band, thespians, robotics and National Honor Society. I graduated in 2014 with a 3.8 (?) GPA. I chose to attend Kansas State University, majoring in Software Engineering. I was awarded the Putnam Scholarship, which I maintained until graduation. I graduated May 2018 with a 3.69 GPA. During my 4 years there I worked for ResNet and as a computer support technician. I also did an internship at Garmin, which afforded me a valuable learning experience.
				</p>
				<p>
					In my spare time I enjoy following MLS soccer, especially Sporting Kansas City. I also enjoy strategy board games, concerts and computer and video games.
